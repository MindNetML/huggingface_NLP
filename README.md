# Hugging Face NLP Course Project

This repository contains my work and notes for the Hugging Face NLP course, implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. Throughout this course, I've explored various aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Hugging Face's tools and models.

## Project Overview

The project is structured as a series of Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on different topics covered in the Hugging Face NLP course. These notebooks include hands-on exercises, experimentation with different NLP models, and my personal insights and conclusions.

### Contents

- An introductory notebook to Transformers and Hugging Face.
- Exploring text classification models and techniques.
- Implementing sequence labeling for named entity recognition.
- Building a question-answering system using pre-trained models.
- Experimenting with text generation capabilities.
